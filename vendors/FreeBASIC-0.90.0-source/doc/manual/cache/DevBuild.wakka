{{fbdoc item="title" value="Getting the FreeBASIC source code and compiling it"}}----

The source code of ""FreeBASIC"" is maintained on Sourceforge using the Git version control system, which allows different developers to work on the source code at the same time and later combine their work. It is possible for users to download this source code using anonymous read access and compile it using GNU development tools.

Compiling the development version is not recommended for most users. ""FreeBASIC"" is a self-hosting compiler, still in active development, so there will be times when the current development version cannot be compiled by the last official release. Note also that the procedures for building the compiler described here may change with future versions of ""FreeBASIC"".

On Windows, ""MinGW""/""MSYS"" is used to compile ""FreeBASIC"". Linux users will usually have the required development tools installed on their system already. The Cygwin build may be useful for Windows users wishing to access Linux libraries in windows. The DOS build is normally compiled on Windows using DJGPP. Advanced users may be able to cross-compile between other builds, but the correct development tools and libraries would be needed, and it has not been widely tested.

{{anchor name="DjgppBuild"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="Compiling for DOS using DJGPP on Win32"}}

	1) The DOS version of ""FreeBASIC"" is typically compiled on a Windows system with DJGPP and a DOS version of ""FreeBASIC"" installed. Download the latest ""FreeBASIC-dos"" release from the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/files/Binaries%20-%20DOS/ FreeBASIC's download site]]. It should be extracted somewhere like ##""C:\FBDOS""##. We'll use it to bootstrap the new FB compiler.
	
	
	1) The DJGPP packages can be found on the [[http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html DJGPP homepage]]. ""FreeBASIC"" needs djdev204.zip from DJGPP 2.04 (DJGPP downloads directory: ##[[http://www.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/beta/v2/ beta/v2/]]##), but for the others it should be ok to use the ones from DJGPP 2.03 (DJGPP downloads directory: ##[[http://www.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/ current/v2gnu/]]##). Setup DJGPP by extracting everything into ##""C:\DJGPP""## and adding an environment variable named "DJGPP", set to ##""C:\DJGPP\djgpp.env""##.
	
	
		- ##binutils## (##bnu*b.zip##, ##bnu*a.zip##)
		- ##bash## (##bsh*.zip##)
		- ##djdev## (##djdev*.zip##) - //pick up djdev204.zip or later from the ##beta/## directory//
		- ##fileutils## (##fil*.zip##)
		- ##gcc## (##gcc*b.zip##)
		- ##gpp## (##gpp*b.zip##)
		- ##make## (##mak*b.zip##)
		- ##shellutils## (##shl*b.zip##)
		- ##textutils## (##txt*b.zip##)
	
		It can be useful (especially when working in parallel with ""MinGW"") to use a batch script to launch a terminal with the DJGPP tools in its PATH environment variable, instead of modifying the system's global PATH environment variable:
		
		%%set DJGPP=C:\DJGPP\djgpp.env
set PATH=C:\DJGPP\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\FBDOS;%PATH%
cd C:\
cmd%%
	1) After having installed DJGPP and opened a command prompt with ##""C:\DJGPP\bin""## in its path, running gcc should run the DJGPP gcc:
	
	
		%%> gcc --version
gcc.exe (GCC) 4.7.1
Copyright (C) 2012 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
%%
	1) The traditional FB-dos setup is a standalone setup, so we will use ENABLE_STANDALONE for the new build.
	
	
		Assuming the ""FreeBASIC"" sources are located at ##""C:\fbc-dos""##, create a ##""C:\fbc-dos\config.mk""## file containing something like the following:
		
		%%ENABLE_STANDALONE := YesPlease
%%
	1) Then, run "make" from a cmd.exe prompt and let it compile FB:
	
	
		%%> cd C:\fbc-dos
> make
%%
	1) Copy these files to ##""C:\fbc-dos\bin\dos""##:
	
		-##""C:\DJGPP\bin\{ar,as,ld}.exe""##
	
	1) Copy these files to ##""C:\fbc-dos\lib\dos""##:
	
		-##""C:\DJGPP\lib\{crt0,gcrt0}.o""##
		-##""C:\DJGPP\lib\lib{emu,m}.a""##
		-##""C:\DJGPP\lib\gcc\djgpp\version\lib{gcc,supcxx}.a""##, and rename ##libsupcxx.a## to ##libsupcx.a## (8.3 file name)
		-##""C:\FBDOS\lib\dos\libc.a""## //- this should be the modified ##libc.a## from the latest ""FreeBASIC"" release. To use the libc.a from DJGPP, the _main.o it contains needs to be replaced with the one compiled from ##""contrib/djgpp/libc/crt0/_main.c""## from the fbc source code, to fix a bug in the original version from DJGPP.//
		-and any additional libraries you want to use
	
	1) Rename ##""C:\fbc-dos\fbc-new.exe""## to ##""C:\fbc-dos\fbc.exe""##, if wanted
	
	
	1) The newly built FB setup can be tested right from the source tree, or you can copy it somewhere else. Make sure to copy all of the following files and directories:
		- ##""fbc.exe""##
		- ##""bin/dos/""##
		- ##""inc/""##
		- ##""lib/dos/""##

{{anchor name="Linux32Build"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="Compiling on x86 GNU/Linux"}}

	1) First, we'll need a working FB setup to bootstrap the new FB compiler. Download the latest ""FreeBASIC-linux"" release from [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/files/Binaries%20-%20Linux/ FreeBASIC's download site]], then extract and install it:
	
	
		%%$ tar zxf FreeBASIC-X.XX.X-linux.tar.gz
$ cd FreeBASIC-X.XX.X-linux
$ sudo ./install.sh -i
%%
	1) The following DEB packages plus dependencies are needed (with RPM names in parentheses):
	
	
		- ##gcc##
		- ##""g++""## (##""gcc-c++""##)
		- ##binutils##
		- ##make##
		- ##libncurses5-dev## (##ncurses-devel##)
		- ##libx11-dev## (##libX11-devel##)
		- ##libxext-dev## (##libXext-devel##)
		- ##libxpm-dev## (##libXpm-devel##)
		- ##libxrandr-dev## (##libXrandr-devel##)
		- ##libxrender-dev## (##libXrender-devel##)
		- ##libgpm-dev## (##gpm-devel##)
		- ##libgl1-mesa-dev##, ##libglu1-mesa-dev## (##Mesa-devel##) - //""OpenGL"" development files//
		- ##libffi-dev## (##ffi-devel##) - //foreign function interface for ##[[KeyPgThreadcall ThreadCall]]##//
	
	1) The traditional FB-linux setup is a normal FB setup that uses the system's tools and libraries. Usually it's not necessary to put anything inside config.mk.
	
	
	1) Assuming the ""FreeBASIC"" sources are located at ##""~/fbc""##, run "make" there and let it compile FB:
	
	
		%%$ cd ~/fbc
$ make
%%
	1) Optionally, install the newly built into the path specified by the ##prefix## variable (defaults to /usr/local):
	
	
		%%$ make install
%%

{{anchor name="Linux64Build"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="Compiling for x86 GNU/Linux on x86_64 GNU/Linux"}}

	1) Currently, FB only supports 32bit, and there is no 64bit port yet, but it is still possible to run and compile 32bit FB on a 64bit system. Just like with the 32bit GNU/Linux build, we'll need a working FB setup to bootstrap the new FB compiler. Download the latest ""FreeBASIC-linux"" release from [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/files/Binaries%20-%20Linux/ FreeBASIC's download site]], then extract and install it:
	
	
		%%$ tar zxf FreeBASIC-X.XX.X-linux.tar.gz
$ cd FreeBASIC-X.XX.X-linux
$ sudo ./install.sh -i
%%
	1) The following DEB packages plus dependencies are needed:
	
	
		- ##libc6-dev-i386##
		- ##binutils##
		- ##gcc-multilib##
		- ##""g++-multilib""##
		- ##lib32ncurses5-dev##
		- ##make##
		- ##libx11-dev## - //for the X11 headers//
		- ##libxext-dev##
		- ##libxpm-dev##
		- ##libxrandr-dev##
		- ##libxrender-dev##
		- ##libgl1-mesa-dev## - //for the ""OpenGL"" headers//
		- ##libglu1-mesa-dev##
		- ##libgpm-dev## - //for the GPM headers//
		- ##ia32-libs-dev## - //for 32bit X11 and ""OpenGL"" development libraries on Debian//
		- ##lib32ffi-dev##
	
	1) Assuming the ""FreeBASIC"" sources are located at ##""~/fbc""##, create a ##""~/fbc/config.mk""## file with the following content:
	
	
		%%CC := gcc -m32
TARGET_ARCH := x86
%%
		This tells the FB makefile to use ##gcc -m32## instead of ##gcc##, which causes all C code to be compiled for x86 rather than x86_64. Furthermore, explicitly setting the TARGET_ARCH to x86 is necessary to get the makefile to select the proper x86 rtlib/gfxlib2 modules, because otherwise the makefile would rely on the output of ##uname -m##, which happens to be x86_64. But since we want to compile for 32bit, we need to override that.
	
	1) Run "make" and let it compile FB:
	
	
		%%$ cd ~/fbc
$ make
%%
	1) Optionally, install the newly built into the path specified by the ##prefix## variable (defaults to /usr/local):
	
	
		%%$ make install
%%

{{anchor name="TdmgccBuild"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="Compiling on Win32 using TDM-GCC and MSYS"}}

	1) We will need a working FB-win32 installation to bootstrap the new FB compiler. Download the latest ""FreeBASIC-win32"" release from [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/files/Binaries%20-%20Win32/ FreeBASIC's download site]] and extract/install it somewhere like ##""C:\FB-win32""##.
	
	
	1) The ""Win32"" version of ""FreeBASIC"" is typically compiled on ""Win32"" using TDM-GCC (SJLJ -- setjump/longjump exception handling mode). Grab the TDM-GCC installer from [[http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download]] and install the recommended TDM-GCC C and ""C++"" packages into ##""C:\TDM-GCC""##.
	
	
	1) The needed MSYS packages can be downloaded and extracted by using the latest version of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get/ mingw-get program]]. It can be extracted into the same directory as TDM-GCC; then it would install the MSYS files into ##""C:\TDM-GCC\msys\1.0""##, and as long as you do not use it to intall ""MinGW"" packages, there should be no conflict with the TDM-GCC files.
	
	
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/msys-core/ msys-core]]##
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/bash/ bash]]## (terminal/shell)
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/coreutils/ msys-coreutils]]##
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/findutils/ msys-findutils]]## (xargs for running the test suite)
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/make/ msys-make]]##
	
	1) After installing MSYS, you can open the MSYS bash by running ##""C:\TDM-GCC\msys\1.0\msys.bat""##. You have to make sure the FB makefile will find the fbc and gcc programs; in order to do this typically the ##""C:\TDM-GCC\bin""## and ##""C:\FB-win32""## directories are added to the PATH environment variable. In order to avoid modifying the system-wide PATH, you may use a .bat script like the following to open an MSYS bash with the needed PATH setting, everytime you need it:
	
	
		%%set PATH=%PATH%;C:\TDM-GCC\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\FB-win32
C:\TDM-GCC\msys\1.0\msys.bat
%%
	1) In order to compile ""FreeBASIC""'s gfxlib2, ""DirectX"" headers are needed in ##""C:\TDM-GCC\include""##, specifically ##ddraw.h## and ##dinput.h##. You can get the headers from here: [[http://alleg.sourceforge.net/files/dx80_mgw.zip]]
	
	
	1) The traditional FB-win32 setup is a standalone setup, so we will use ENABLE_STANDALONE for the new build.
	
	
		Assuming the ""FreeBASIC"" sources are located at ##""C:\fbc""##, create a ##""C:\fbc\config.mk""## file containing something like the following:
		
		%%# FB-win32 typically is built as standalone
ENABLE_STANDALONE := YesPlease

# For TDM-GCC which doesn't have libgcc_eh, unlike MinGW.org
FBCFLAGS := -d ENABLE_TDMGCC
%%
	1) Run "make" (from inside the MSYS bash) and let it compile FB:
	
	
		%%$ cd /c/fbc
$ make
%%
	1) Copy to ##""C:\fbc\bin\win32""##:
		- ##""C:\TDM-GCC\bin\{ar,as,dlltool,ld}.exe""##
		- ##""GoRC.exe""## (from [[http://www.godevtool.com/]] or the previous ""FreeBASIC"" release)
	
	1) Copy to ##""C:\fbc\lib\win32""##:
		- ##""C:\TDM-GCC\lib\{crt2,dllcrt2,gcrt2}.o""##
		- ##""C:\TDM-GCC\lib\lib{gmon,mingw32,mingwex,moldname}.a""##
		- ##""C:\TDM-GCC\lib\gcc\mingw32\version\{crtbegin,crtend}.o""##
		- ##""C:\TDM-GCC\lib\gcc\mingw32\version\lib{gcc,supc++}.a""##
		- ##""C:\TDM-GCC\lib\lib{advapi32,gdi32,kernel32,msvcrt,user32,winmm,winspool}.a""## //(rename to ##lib*.dll.a##)//
		- and any additional libraries you want to use
	
	1) Rename ##""C:\fbc\fbc-new.exe""## to ##""C:\fbc\fbc.exe""##, if wanted
	
	
	1) The newly built FB setup can be tested right from the source tree, or you can copy it somewhere else. Make sure to copy all of the following files and directories:
		- ##""fbc.exe""##
		- ##""bin/win32/""##
		- ##""inc/""##
		- ##""lib/win32/""##

{{anchor name="MingwBuild"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="Compiling on Win32 using MinGW/MSYS, for installation into the MinGW tree"}}

	1) We will need a working FB-win32 installation to bootstrap the new FB compiler. Download the latest ""FreeBASIC-win32"" release from [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/files/Binaries%20-%20Win32/ FreeBASIC's download site]] and extract/install it somewhere like ##""C:\FB-win32""##.
	
	
	1) To install [[http://www.mingw.org MinGW/MSYS]], download the latest version of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get/ mingw-get program]] and extract it into ##""C:\MinGW""##. After that open a command prompt (cmd.exe) and run:
	
	
		%%> C:\MinGW\bin\mingw-get.exe update
> C:\MinGW\bin\mingw-get.exe install <package-names>
%%
		The following packages need to be installed via ##mingw-get install## (or by downloading & extracting them manually):
	
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/gcc/Version4/ gcc-core]]##
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/gcc/Version4/ gcc-g++]]## (only needed to get ""libsupc++.a"")
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/binutils/ binutils]]##
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/mingw-rt/ mingwrt]]##
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/w32api/ w32api]]##
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/msys-core/ msys-core]]##
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/bash/ bash]]## (terminal/shell)
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/coreutils/ msys-coreutils]]##
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/findutils/ msys-findutils]]## (xargs for running the test suite)
		- ##[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/make/ msys-make]]##
	
	1) After installing MSYS, you can open the MSYS bash by running ##""C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat""##. You have to make sure the FB makefile will find the fbc and gcc programs; in order to do this, typically the ##""C:\MinGW\bin""## and ##""C:\FB-win32""## directories are added to the PATH environment variable. In order to avoid modifying the system-wide PATH, you may use a .bat script like the following to open an MSYS bash with the needed PATH setting, everytime you need it:
	
	
		%%set PATH=%PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin
set PATH=C:\FB-win32;%PATH%
C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat
%%
		It is also possible to use ""MinGW/MSYS"" programs from the cmd.exe command prompt, if you prefer. For that it may be worth it to add ##""C:\MinGW\bin""##, ##""C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin""## and ##""C:\FB-win32""## to the system's global PATH environment variable.
	
	1) In order to compile ""FreeBASIC""'s gfxlib2, ""DirectX"" headers are needed in ##""C:\MinGW\include""##, specifically ##ddraw.h## and ##dinput.h##. You can get the headers from here: [[http://alleg.sourceforge.net/files/dx80_mgw.zip]]
	
	
	1) This fbc build for ""MinGW"" will be a normal build, with the same directory structure as on Linux. Normally it is not necessary to put anything into config.mk, except perhaps the proper ##prefix## setting.
	
	
		Assuming the ""FreeBASIC"" sources are located at ##""C:\fbc""##, create a ##""C:\fbc\config.mk""## file containing something like the following:
		
		%%prefix := C:/MinGW
%%
	1) Run "make" (from inside the MSYS bash) and let it compile FB:
	
	
		%%$ cd /c/fbc
$ make
%%
	1) Optionally, install the newly built FB into the path specified by the ##prefix## variable:
	
	
		%%$ make install
%%

{{anchor name="RecompileAfterUpdates"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="Getting source code updates and recompiling"}}

	To download updates made available in the fbc Git repository, you can do a pull, either using your preferred graphical Git tool, or in a terminal:
	
		%%git pull
%%
	To take a look at incoming changes //before// applying them, do this:
	
		%%# Update remote branches
git fetch

# Take a look
gitk --all

# Everything looks ok? Then merge the remote branch into the current branch to apply the update.
git merge origin/master
%%
	Rebuilding is, most of the time, as easy as:
	
		%%make
%%
	If compilation options (like ENABLE_STANDALONE) were used for the previous build, it's necessary to specify them again this time, unless they are (still) set in ##config.mk##.
	
	As a special exception, for the DOS build it is necessary to run ##make clean## before ##make## to properly rebuild FB after source modules have been renamed or deleted. The reason for this is that under DOS/DJGPP the makefile uses *.o wildcards to link fbc and archive libfb.a etc., instead of passing the explicit .o file names, because it has to obey the command line length limitation. If ##make clean## is not run, it may use old left-over object files from a previous build.

{{anchor name="Debugging"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="Debugging FB"}}

	For debugging and development it's a good idea to build the compiler with -g and -exx to enable assertions and NULL pointer/array boundary checks. For the rtlib/gfxlib2 code, -DDEBUG enables the assertions. Just update config.mk and (re)build. Example config.mk settings:
	
	%%FBFLAGS := -g -exx
CFLAGS := -g -O0 -DDEBUG
%%
	Running fbc inside gdb would typically look something like:
	
	%%gdb --args fbc test.bas
%%
	Also note that fbc can be tested right from inside the build tree, without being "installed" somewhere else, which also is a great debugging and development help.

{{anchor name="MakefileCommands"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="Makefile commands"}}

	- none or ##all##
		The default - builds everything that needs to be built
	
	- ##compiler##, ##rtlib##, ##gfxlib2##
		Used to build a specific component only. For example, this can be used to build an ##rtlib## for a specific target, in order to be able to cross-compile FB programs (such as the ##compiler##) for that target.
	
	- ##clean[-component]##
		Used to remove built files. ##make clean## removes all built files, while for example ##make clean-compiler## removes only the files built for the compiler, allowing the compiler to be recompiled more quickly, without the need to rebuild the whole rtlib/gfxlib2 code.
	
	- ##install[-component]##, ##uninstall[-component]##
		Used to copy the built files into the directory specified by the ##prefix## variable, or remove them from there. This is most useful to install the normal build into /usr/local on Linux/BSD systems. For the standalone build, ##make install## will also work and copy over or remove the files. However, the standalone build uses an incompatible directory layout and should not be installed into /usr/local or similar directories because of this.
		
		Note that it is fine to run the newly built FB setup right from the directory where it was compiled; ##make install## is not necessary to make it work (unless the prefix path was hard-coded into the compiler via ENABLE_PREFIX).
		
		Additionally there are ##install-includes## and ##uninstall-includes## commands, which copy/remove just the FB includes (header files). Note that there is no ##make includes## or similar command, as the includes do not need to be built.

{{anchor name="MakefileConfig"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="Makefile configuration (variables to set on the make command line or inside config.mk)"}}

	- ##FBFLAGS##, ##FBCFLAGS##, ##FBLFLAGS##
		Extra fbc flags to be used when compiling and/or linking the compiler
	
	- ##CFLAGS##
		Extra gcc flags to be used when compiling rtlib and gfxlib2
	
	- ##prefix##
		Changes the /usr/local prefix to something else. Note: MSYS maps ##/usr/local## to ##C:\msys\1.0\local##.
		
		This is only used...
			- by the makefile's ##install## and ##uninstall## commands, 
			- in the compiler (hard-coded) if ENABLE_PREFIX was used
		
		Note that in combination with bash on ""Win32"" (e.g. from DJGPP or MSYS) it's necessary to use forward slashes instead of backslashes in directory paths, for example: ##""prefix=C:/MinGW""##
	
	- ##TARGET##
		This variable can be set to a system triplet in order to cross-compile using that GCC cross-compiler toolchain. The makefile will use ##''fbc -target $(TARGET)''## instead of ##''fbc''##, and ##''$(TARGET)-gcc''## instead of ##''gcc''##.
		
		For example, on a Debian GNU/Linux system with the i686-w64-mingw32 GCC cross-compiler installed, you can build the win32 rtlib like this:
		
		%%# Build the win32 rtlib/gfxlib2
make rtlib gfxlib2 TARGET=i686-w64-mingw32

# Install it into /usr/local/lib/i686-w64-mingw32-freebasic
make install-rtlib install-gfxlib2 TARGET=i686-w64-mingw32
%%
		It will supplement the existing fbc installation in /usr/local, like a plugin, and from now on you can cross-compile FB programs for win32 by doing:
		
		%%fbc -target i686-w64-mingw32 ...
%%
	- ##FBC##, ##CC##, ##AR##
		These variables specify the fbc, gcc and ar programs used during the build. You can specify them to override the defaults, for example:
		
			- ##""make FBC=~/FreeBASIC-0.23.0-linux/fbc""##
			- ##make CC="gcc -m32"##
		
		##FBC## affects the ##compiler## source code only, while ##CC## and ##AR## are used for ##rtlib## and ##gfxlib2##.
	
	- ##V##
		##V## for verbose. By default, the makefile does not display the full command lines used during compilation, but just prints out the latest tool and file name combination to give a better visual indication of the build progress. It also makes warnings and errors stand out more in the console window. If the variable ##V## is set, the echoing tricks are disabled and full command lines will be shown, as GNU make normally does.
	
	- ##ENABLE_STANDALONE=1##
		Build a standalone FB setup instead of the normal Unix-style setup, see also: [[DevNormalVsStandalone the standalone vs. normal comparison]]. This causes the makefile to use the standalone directory layout and to use ##-d ENABLE_STANDALONE## when building the compiler.
	
	- ##ENABLE_PREFIX=1##
		This causes the makefile to use ##-d ENABLE_PREFIX=$(prefix)## when building the compiler.
	
	- ##ENABLE_SUFFIX=foo##
		This causes the makefile to use ##-d ENABLE_SUFFIX=$(ENABLE_SUFFIX)## when building the compiler, and to append the given suffix string to the fbc executable's and lib/ directories' names.
		
		For example, using ##ENABLE_PREFIX=-0.24## will give you fbc-0.24.exe and a lib/freebasic-0.24/ directory, instead of fbc.exe and lib/freebasic/. This allows installing multiple versions of compiler and runtime in parallel. Note: The include/ directory name is not affected, and the FB headers are always shared by all installed FB versions (FB's headers and their directory layouts are designed to be able to do that). This is only supported for the normal (non-standalone) build.

	- ##-d ENABLE_STANDALONE##
		This makes the compiler behave as a standalone tool that cannot rely on the system to have certain programs or libraries. See [[DevNormalVsStandalone the normal vs. standalone comparison]] for more information.
	
	- ##-d ENABLE_TDMGCC##
		This makes the compiler work with TDM-GCC libraries instead of ""MinGW.org"" libraries. Currently the only difference is that under ""MinGW.org"", the compiler has to link in libgcc_eh to satisfy dependencies, while this is not needed under TDM-GCC, which does not even have this library. The difference is caused by the exception handling mechanisms the toolchains are configured to use: TDM-GCC with SJLJ, ""MinGW.org"" with DW2.
	
	- ##-d ENABLE_SUFFIX=foo##
		This makes the compiler append the given suffix to the lib/freebasic/ directory name when searching for its own lib/freebasic/ directory. For example, ##-d ENABLE_SUFFIX=-0.24## causes it to look for lib/freebasic-0.24/ instead of lib/freebasic/. This is only supported for the normal (non-standalone) build.
	
	- ##-d ENABLE_PREFIX=/some/path##
		This causes the given prefix path to be hard-coded into the compiler. It will no longer use exepath() and be relocatable. This may only be useful if its known that the compiler does not need to be relocatable, or if exepath() does not work.

{{anchor name="RtlibSourceConfig"}}{{fbdoc item="section" value="rtlib and gfxlib2 source code configuration (CFLAGS)"}}

	- ##-DDISABLE_X11##
		With this, the Unix rtlib/gfxlib2 will not use X11 headers, disabling gfxlib2's X11 graphics driver and some of the rtlib's Linux console functionality (affects multikey() and console mouse handling)
	
	- ##-DDISABLE_GPM##
		With this, the Linux rtlib will not use General Purpose Mouse headers (gpm.h), disabling the Linux [[KeyPgGetmouse GetMouse]] functionality.
	
	- ##-DDISABLE_FFI##
		With this, the rtlib will not use libffi headers (ffi.h), disabling the [[KeyPgThreadcall ThreadCall]] functionality.
	
	- ##-DDISABLE_OPENGL##
		With this, the gfxlib2 will not use ""OpenGL"" headers, disabling the ""OpenGL"" graphics drivers.

		Both the ""MinGW runtime"" and ""MinGW GCC"" have a ##float.h## header, and in some setups the GCC one is found before the ""MinGW"" one, causing the above errors. This issue shows up with some ""MinGW"" setups, for example gcc-core-4.6.1 + mingwrt-3.20, while for example gcc-core-4.5.2 + mingwrt-3.18 (a previous installation made with mingw-get) works fine. This problem also shows up with mingw32 cross compiler on Debian (gcc 4.4.4, mingwrt 3.13).
		
		Easiest temporary fix: Append ###include_next <float.h>## to ##""C:\MinGW\lib\gcc\mingw32\version\include\float.h""##

	{{fbdoc item="subsect" value="MinGW binutils ld versions 2.18 to 2.21"}}
	
		fbc triggers a bug (ld/12614) in the mentioned linker versions causing it to produce broken binaries. It's fixed in binutils 2.21.1 and up.
	
	{{fbdoc item="subsect" value="MinGW GCC 4.7.0  __attribute__((packed)) broken"}}
	
		The FB rtlib's FB_DATADESC structure which uses ""__attribute__((packed))"" is miscompiled by default under ""MinGW"" GCC 4.7.0, due to the -mms-bitfields option being enabled by default since gcc 4.7.0. See also [[http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52991 GCC bug 52991]] and [[http://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=20233 this FB forum thread]]. The work-around for now is to compile the rtlib with -mno-ms-bitfields, for example with this in config.mk:
		
		%%# work around new gcc 4.7 default (see gcc bug 52991)
CFLAGS := -O2 -mno-ms-bitfields
%%
	
	{{fbdoc item="subsect" value="-lXpm not found on Debian x86_64"}}
	
		The ia32-libs-dev package (for example on Debian 6) for some reason does not contain a /usr/lib32/libXpm.so symlink, even though it does contain those for the other X11 development libraries. This apparently can be fixed by creating the symlink manually:
		
		%%ln -s /usr/lib32/libXpm.so.4 /usr/lib32/libXpm.so
