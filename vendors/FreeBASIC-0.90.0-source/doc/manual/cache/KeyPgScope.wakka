Statement to begin a new scope block

	**Scope**

	**End Scope**
##
{{fbdoc item="desc"}}
	The Scope block allows variables to be temporarily (re)defined and used in a program.  When a variable is defined with ##[[KeyPgDim Dim]]## within a scope structure, that variable can be used until the end of the scope.  During this time, any variables outside the scope that have the same name will be ignored, and will not be accessible by that name.

	Any statements in the Scope block before the variable is dimensioned will use the variable as defined outside the Scope.

	##**Scope..End Scope**## is not permitted when compiling with in the //[[CompilerOptlang -lang qb]]// dialect.
